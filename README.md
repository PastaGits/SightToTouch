# SightToTouch

An iPhone app that can be used completely without hands. This app uses the TrueDepth camera (hardware that is installed in the iPhone X - current model) 
to track the eyes of the user. The user can use the app with just their eyes to move a cursor and can make a "duck-mouth" as an input/clicking command. 
This app was my senior design project at CSUN.

Installation Instructions (via the Xcode IDE & iPhone):

1.) Download ZIP 

2.) Launch the Xcode IDE and select 'Open a project or file'

3.) In the Project navigator, right click on 'Eye Tracking'

4.) Select 'Add Files to "Eye Tracking"...' 

5.) Browse in the downloaded zip folder for and select 'DocumentationET.xcodeproj' 

6.) Physically connect your iPhone and select the device instead of the simulators listed (Look towards the top middle part of the screen for this)

7.) Run the build

Note: If errors occur in the general settings of the IDE, then the project would need to be created as a new project and the files would then need to be imported
individually. Also, no simulators listed in the Xcode IDE can run this project, an iPhone model of X or subsequent models of X would be needed to run and test the 
project.
